# Monitoring-the-Data-Information-of-Filipino-Citizen-in-the-Philippines

**Introduction:**

       Poverty and inequality have been recurrent challenges in the Philippines and have again come to the fore in the wake of the 
     current global financial crisis and rising food, fuel, and commodity prices experienced in 2008. The proportion of households 
     living below the official poverty line has declined very slowly and unevenly in the past four decades, and poverty reduction 
     has been much slower than in neighbouring countries such as the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Indonesia, Thailand, and 
     Viet Nam. The growth of the economy has been characterized by boom and bust cycles and current episodes of moderate economic 
     expansion have had limited impact on poverty reduction. Other reasons for the relatively moderate poverty decline include the 
     high rate of inequality across income brackets, regions, and sectors; and unmanaged population growth. 
       This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the causes of poverty in the Philippines and give recommendations for 
     accelerating poverty reduction through sustained and more inclusive growth. The study will provide an overview of the current
     status of government responses, strategies, and achievements and will identify and prioritize future needs and interventions. 
     Millennium Development Goal (MDG) accomplishments to date will also be assessed. It will examine implications of the current 
     financial crisis on poverty and recommend ways to move forward. The study is based on analytical work using current literature 
     and the latest available data, including the 2006 Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES).

**Problem Statement:**

        Poverty occurs for many reasons, but in the Philippines there are recurring factors that have slowed the development progress. 
      Economic growth is low compared to neighbouring countries. GDP growth is comparable, however, GDP per capita in relation to 
      the increase of population is much slower. Poverty directly impacts economic growth due to constraints in credit and the 
      underdevelopment of the financial market and inequality in income and assets. Another cause of poverty in the Philippines is 
      the rise of unmanaged population growth. Because the poor tend to have bigger families, they are unable to access health 
      services or sex education, which leads to more children and the continuation of that cycle. The pattern of growth is common 
      in rural areas, but there has been a rise in poverty in urban areas. Cities in the Philippines have been faced with an increase
      in poverty due to lack of well-paid employment. One of the main causes of poverty in the Philippines is the vulnerability 
      to natural disasters. Natural disasters in the Philippines have caused US$23 billion in damages since 1990, which continues to 
      delay the development process. 
         According to the DW, the Philippines is the most vulnerable country to typhoons, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in the 
      world.  The frequent occurrences cost the country lives, illness, malnutrition, and denial of education and health services. 
      Filipino farmers are some of the most vulnerable, because floods and landslides severely affect their crops and income. 
      Another cause of poverty is the lack of research on poverty and the effective policies to implement in order to prevent further
      damage. This lack of research has caused deficient targeting in poverty programs, and unsuccessful current processes. Until 
      more research is done as to how exactly tackle the poverty trap programs will not be effective.

**Significance of the Proposed Project:**
      
         This research will provide the data information of every Filipino Citizen in the Philippines. The research will specially 
      benefit the following:
      
      • Government - the most likely to benefit from our research. Because they'll know how much poverty there is in the 
      Philippines, which will help them with their poverty research. It is easier for the government to assist disadvantaged 
      individuals. It will be simpler for them to create different companies for different locations so that they can readily feed
      the underprivileged. They will go for it, especially with thin youngsters, and will provide free check-ups and medicine. So
      that they will be healthy and malnourished youngsters will not enter our population. Poverty means that the income level from 
      employment is so low that basic human needs can't be met. Poverty-stricken people and families might go without proper housing, 
      clean water, healthy food, and medical attention. Each nation may have its own criteria for determining how many of its people 
      are living in poverty.

      • Community – donate money and time, and look for volunteer opportunities One of the most simple ways to assist your community 
      battle poverty is to donate money to organizations whose aim is to eliminate economic inequality. There is no such thing as a 
      tiny or huge sum of money. As the money accumulate, groups can use them to address housing inequities, education gaps, food 
      insecurity, and other issues. Another useful alternative is to join forces with local organizations that aid the community by 
      contributing their time. There are methods to have an effect that don't require money, whether it's volunteering in a food 
      pantry or working with children after school to help them finish their homework. To help us continue our work, we've created a 
      volunteer waitlist that you can join.

      • Citizen –  the benefits here will be able to achieve our dream of being able to study and then value education as a student 
      who has a beak, can work well, no one will go hungry, and it will be difficult to work hard, we will rise in life, and we will
      not be able to increase the population of poor people to eat three times a day all the poor, and we will assist with the 
      activities that will take place in our area to also help stop poverty in the Philippines.


      • Future Researchers - this paper will review a wide range of this research and discuss the underlying perspectives that 
      characterize entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation. We will, in turn, use these perspectives to lay out an agenda for 
      future research.

**Methods:**

        The study uses a comprehensive framework for assessing poverty in the country. It examines the key areas that are relevant 
      to poverty reduction: increasing incomes, human capital, and capacity; risk protection; and voice and empowerment in governance 
      and institutions. It uses quantitative (trends in poverty and related indicators data, regression analysis for poverty 
      correlates) and qualitative analysis (key informant interviews) to assess the poverty situation as it relates to the overall 
      development of the country. A workshop was organized to discuss the findings of the study, to get feedback from key stakeholders,
      and to identify concrete and actionable recommendations. An institutional mapping analysis was also undertaken to assess the 
      current responses to the state of poverty in the country.

**Expected Output:**
        
         This research aims to track and collect data on every Filipino citizen in the Philippines in order to identify the need 
      to focus more and pay attention in order to permanently reduce the number of poor people in the Philippines. Additionally, 
      The First Semester 2021 poverty incidence among population, or the proportion of poor Filipinos whose per capita income is
      not sufficient to meet their basic food and non-food needs, was estimated at 23.7 percent. This translates to 26.14 million 
      Filipinoscwho lived below the poverty threshold estimated at Php12, 082, on the average, for a family of five per month 
      in the first semester of 2021. On the other hand, subsistence incidence among Filipinos, or the proportion of Filipinos whose 
      income is not enough to meet even the basic food needs, was registered at 9.9 percent or about 10.94 million Filipinos 
      in the first semester of 2021. On the average, the monthly food threshold for a family of five for the same period was 
      estimated at Php8, 393. (Figure 1, and Tables 2 and 4). Among families, the First Semester 2021 poverty incidence was 
      estimated at 18.0 percent, which is equivalent to around 4.74 million poor families. Meanwhile, the subsistence incidence 
      among families was recorded at 7.1 percent, or around 1.87 million food poor families in the first semester of 2021. 
      (Tables 1 and 3).
	        This data will be updated on a regular basis to see if there has been a significant shift in the impact of this research 
      on each other and, in particular, on the government that oversees it.


**Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Project:**
	
          These SDGs are further described as follows;

      Goal 1: No Poverty - This goal strives to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. These SDG will create sound policy 
      frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies,
      to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions.

      Goal 2: Zero Hunger - End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
